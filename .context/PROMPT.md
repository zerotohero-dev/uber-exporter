# Project Session Prompt

<!-- ctx:prompt -->
<!-- DO NOT REMOVE: This marker indicates ctx-managed content -->

## On Session Start

1. Read this file (you're doing it now)
2. Run `ctx status` to see current context summary
3. Check `.context/TASKS.md` for active work items

## Context Files

| File                         | Purpose                                  |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `.context/CONSTITUTION.md`   | Hard rules: NEVER violate                |
| `.context/TASKS.md`          | Current work items                       |
| `.context/DECISIONS.md`      | Architectural decisions with rationale   |
| `.context/LEARNINGS.md`      | Gotchas and lessons learned              |
| `.context/CONVENTIONS.md`    | Code patterns and standards              |
| `.context/AGENT_PLAYBOOK.md` | How to persist context, session patterns |

## Working Style

- **Ask questions** when requirements are unclear
- **Persist context** as you work (don't wait for session end)
- **Use `ctx add`** for learnings, decisions, tasks
- **Check existing patterns** before writing new code

## Persist as You Go

After completing meaningful work, capture what matters:

| Trigger                  | Action                                      |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Completed a task         | Mark done in TASKS.md, add learnings if any |
| Made a decision          | `ctx add decision "..."`                    |
| Discovered a gotcha      | `ctx add learning "..."`                    |
| Significant code changes | Consider what's worth capturing             |

Don't wait for the session to end: it may never come cleanly.
