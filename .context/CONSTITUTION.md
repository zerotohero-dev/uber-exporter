# Constitution

<!--
UPDATE WHEN:
- Security requirements change or new vulnerabilities discovered
- New invariants emerge from production incidents
- Team agrees on new inviolable rules
- Existing rules prove too restrictive or too loose

DO NOT UPDATE FOR:
- Preferences or suggestions (use CONVENTIONS.md)
- Temporary constraints (use TASKS.md blockers)
-->

These rules are INVIOLABLE. If a task requires violating these, the task is wrong.

## Security Invariants

- [ ] Never commit secrets, tokens, API keys, or credentials
- [ ] Never store customer/user data in context files

## Quality Invariants

- [ ] All code must pass tests before commit
- [ ] No TODO comments in main branch (move to TASKS.md)
- [ ] Path construction uses stdlib: no string concatenation 
  (security: prevents path traversal)

## Process Invariants

- [ ] All architectural changes require a decision record

## TASKS.md Structure Invariants

TASKS.md must remain a replayable checklist. Uncheck all items and 
re-run = verify/redo all tasks in order.

- [ ] **Never move tasks**: tasks stay in their Phase section permanently
- [ ] **Never remove Phase headers**: Phase labels provide structure and order
- [ ] **Never merge or collapse Phase sections**: each phase is a logical unit
- [ ] **Never delete tasks**: mark as `[x]` completed, or `[-]` skipped with reason
- [ ] **Use inline labels for status**: add `#in-progress` to task text, don't move it
- [ ] **No "In Progress" / "Next Up" sections**: these encourage moving tasks
- [ ] **Ask before restructuring**: if structure changes seem needed, ask the user first

## Context Preservation Invariants

- [ ] **Archival is allowed, deletion is not**: use `ctx tasks archive` to move 
  completed tasks to `.context/archive/`, never delete context history
- [ ] **Archive preserves structure**: archived tasks keep their Phase headers 
  for traceability
